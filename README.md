# Pandas on Pokemon

This repository contains Python code for analyzing Pokemon data using the Pandas library. The analysis focuses on querying and exploring various aspects of Pokemon attributes and types.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Attack Analysis**: Counting Pokemons with Attack > 150.
- **Speed Examination**: Selection of Pokemons with Speed ≤ 10.
- **Special Defense Count**: Number of Pokemons with Sp. Def ≤ 25.
- **Legendary Pokemon**: Extraction of all Legendary Pokemons.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying outliers in Defense values.
- **Type-Based Queries**: Counting Fire-Flying and Poison type Pokemons.
- **Statistical Queries**: Finding Ice type Pokemon with the highest Defense.
- **Legendary Type Analysis**: Determining the most common type among Legendary Pokemons.
- **Generation-Specific Queries**: Finding the most powerful Water and Dragon type Pokemons from specific generations.
- **Advanced Selections**: Retrieving powerful Fire-type and Water-Flying type Pokemons.
- **Column Selection**: Selecting specific columns (Name, Attack, Generation) for Legendary Fire-type Pokemons.
- **Speed Analysis**: Identifying Slowest and Fastest Pokemons.

## Insights and Applications

This project showcases basic to advanced data manipulation techniques using Pandas, essential for tasks in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and querying large datasets. The skills demonstrated here are fundamental in data science for tasks such as predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and deriving actionable insights from structured data.
